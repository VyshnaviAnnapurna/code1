Description:This Python code presents a classic number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Importing Libraries**: The code begins with importing the `random` library to facilitate the generation of random numbers.

2. **Defining the Function**: The `guess_number()` function encapsulates the entire game logic.

3. **Generating the Secret Number**: Inside the function, a secret number is randomly generated using `random.randint(1, 100)`. This number is what the player needs to guess.

4. **Introduction**: The game starts with a welcoming message, informing the player about the game and the range of numbers they need to guess from.

5. **Guessing Loop**: A `while` loop is used to repeatedly prompt the player to input their guess. This loop continues until the player correctly guesses the secret number.

6. **Guess Evaluation**: After each guess, the program evaluates whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Depending on this evaluation, the program provides feedback to the player.

7. **Game End**: Once the player correctly guesses the secret number, the game congratulates them, reveals the secret number, and informs them about the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

8. **Running the Game**: Finally, the `guess_number()` function is called to start the game.

This game provides a simple yet engaging experience for players as they try to guess the hidden number within the given range.
Conclusion:In conclusion, the provided Python code implements a classic number guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides an interactive experience, guiding the player through each guess with hints about whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the secret number. This code demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and random number generation. It offers an enjoyable and educational exercise for beginners learning Python programming or anyone looking for a fun way to pass the time.
